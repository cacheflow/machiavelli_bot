A Twitter bot build using node that uses NLP to parse Machiavelli's The Prince and tweet our random sentences.

#How to run the bot

1. Make sure you have the correct Twitter credentials for your account, which can be found [here](https://apps.twitter.com/)
2. Store your credentials in a safe place. In this app the credentials are stored in the environmental variables within bash and using process.env to access them.
3. Install the node modules using "npm install" from the command line.
4. After you've done the above run 'node twitter.js' from the command line and then navigate to your Twitter account to see the tweet!
